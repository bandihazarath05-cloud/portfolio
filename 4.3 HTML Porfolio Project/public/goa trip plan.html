<h3>3.Fort Aguada</h3>
<p>Fort Aguada is a 17th-century Portuguese fort in Goa, India, known for its well-preserved state and strategic location on the Mandovi River estuary where it meets the Arabian Sea. Built to defend against invaders like the Dutch and Marathas, it also served as a source of fresh water for passing ships, which is how it got its name, from the Portuguese word "aguada" meaning "watering place". Key features include its massive laterite walls, a now-abandoned lighthouse (built in 1864, it is one of the oldest in Asia), and a former jail that is now a museum about the Goan freedom struggle. </p>
